I"<p>For my final <a href="https://bit.ly/uwfsdl">CSEP 590C</a> project at UW (I’m finally graduating with my MS degree🎉), I wanted to apply deep learning techniques to an open source project that I maintain: <a href="https://github.com/lyft/cartography">Cartography</a>. Cartography is a Python tool that pulls data on technical assets from multiple sources, like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">GCP</a>, and represents them in a <a href="https://www.neo4j.com">Neo4j</a> graph database. Using a graph gives us a map of our infrastructure and this is particularly useful for security and infra teams because you can quickly answer complex questions like “if one of my compute instances gets hacked, what else is immediately at risk?”</p>
